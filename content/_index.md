I'm a PhD student at the National University of Singapore.

My primary research interests are programming languages and formal verification, currently of concurrent, distributed, and effectful programs.
I also dabble in static analysis, logic/constraint/answer set programming, and game development.
My goal is to build better tools for developers and lower the barrier to engineering reliable software.

On weekends, I sing with [The Crescendos](https://www.instagram.com/the_crescendos/) and [Acappella Anonymous](https://www.instagram.com/acappellaanonymous/).
