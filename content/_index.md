I'm a PhD student in the [PLSE lab](https://nus-plse.github.io/) at NUS.

My research focuses on applying techniques from programming languages to the verification and testing of distributed systems.

I am more generally interested in all aspects of programming languages and formal verification. My goal is to build better tools for developers and lower the barrier to engineering reliable software.
