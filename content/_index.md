I'm a PhD student at the National University of Singapore.

My primary research interests are programming languages and formal verification, currently of concurrent, distributed, and effectful programs.
I also dabble in static analysis, logic/constraint/answer set programming.
My goal is to build better tools for developers and lower the barrier to engineering reliable software.
