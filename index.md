Hi! I'm a PhD student at the National University of Singapore.

I'm all about finding principled ways to solve problems (with computers) and making people around me more productive. To that end, I'm interested in functional programming, program analysis, formal methods, and declarative paradigms such as logic programming and ASP. I believe sophisticated tools are essential if we wish to create and maintain more complex systems.

I am also an occasional game developer and enjoy building and working with interactive systems.

On weekends, I sing with [The Crescendos](https://www.instagram.com/the_crescendos/) and [Acappella Anonymous](https://www.instagram.com/acappellaanonymous/).
